Here you will find documentation about our efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic, links to other repositories, discussion about the various efforts, Issues, and general information about just what we are doing.

We will also be posting any financial sponsorships for any of our efforts, if any should happen.

### White papers

As part of our efforts we are planning on writing white papers with what we think could be good practices, projects, and proof of concepts. A GitHub Issue will also be created with each white paper as a place to get public comment. All white papers will also be submitted via Pull Request and will only be merged into our master branch with team approvals.

Public comment to the white paper will be open for two weeks as a minimum.

We will be accepting Pull Requests to white papers via Pull Request.
